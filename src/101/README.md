* \<svg\> Wraps and defines the entire graphic. \<svg\> is to a scalable vector graphic what the \<html\> element is to a web page.
* \<line> Makes single straight lines.
* \<polyline> Makes multi-segment lines.
* \<rect> Makes rectangles and squares.
* \<ellipse> Makes circles and ovals.
* \<polygon> Makes straight sided shapes, with three sides or more.
* \<path> Makes any shape you like by defining points and the lines between them.
* \<defs> Defines reusable assets. Nothing placed inside this \<defs> section is visible initially. \<defs> is to a scalable vector graphic what the \<head> element is to a web page.
* \<g> Wraps multiple shapes into a group. Place groups in the \<defs> section to enable them to be reused.
* \<symbol> Like a group, but with some extra features. Typically placed in the \<defs> section.
* \<use> Takes assets defined in the \<defs> section and makes them visible in the SVG.
